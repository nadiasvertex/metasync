# metasync
An experiment in loosely connected, synchronized databases.

This experiment is designed to explore tooling and relational structures that 
facilitate synchronization between occasionally connected multi-master systems.
It is not an attempt to solve the problem generally, but within various kinds
of constraints.

This prototype is written specifically for the PostgreSQL database server, and
expects a standalone distribution to be available. Instructions for making such
a thing will be provided later.
